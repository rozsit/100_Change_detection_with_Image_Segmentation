Change Detection with Instance Segmentation (GeoAI + SAM ViT-H)
This project performs change detection between two geospatial raster images (GeoTIFF) using instance segmentation with the GeoAI library and the Segment Anything Model (SAM, ViT-H variant).
The workflow includes preprocessing, change detection, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Automatic spatial alignment â€“ crops both images to their overlapping geographic extent.

Change detection â€“ detects changes between two time periods using SAM ViT-H.

Probability and binary masks â€“ generates probability maps and binary change masks.

Instance segmentation â€“ identifies individual changed objects with attributes (IoU, stability, area).

Comprehensive reporting â€“ produces detailed visual and statistical reports.

Visualization overlay â€“ displays detected changes as transparent overlays on the newer image.
